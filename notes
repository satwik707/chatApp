we need to refactor and create server because socketio needs server to be passed

in html file socket.io/socket.io/js --this is a client side socket lib
our client side js code will have access to this lib

for location sharing we used geolocation api 

npm bad-words --to disallow and validate bad words

muostache is used for dynamic templates..yahan par we make a dynamic template..then store the msg in it then put it in the specified place

emit--send and on means receive
here index.js is server and chat.js is client

moments.js is used to format the time 

moment.js qs.js and moushtache was loaded as a script in the html file because we need to access it in the js file not the nodejs

qs.js query string is used for parsing the url and giving us the right data i.e
when you click on index.html and submit the form it will redirect you to chat.html and in the url it will show http://localhost:3000/chat.html?username=asd&room=asd
now in this url we need the username and the room..to take it from url in the right format we use qs.js
it will return an object with user:'',and room:''


socket.emit,socket.on,io.emit,socket.broadcast.emit
io.to.emit--sending to everyone inside that particular room
socket.broadcast.to.emit --sending to everyone except the socket in that particular room
